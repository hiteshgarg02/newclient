Client Inventory is project that can utilisied by the companies requiring to maintain the crutial data of there client's and require a user friendly GUI that can be effectively used by there worker's. The Project is being created over AngularJS following the MVC Model to ease the development and maintenance of the project.This demo project will also show the usage of filters,directives and service call in angularjs framework. The data sent and retrieved will be in the form of JSON(Java Script Object Notation) and will be helpful to handle Restful services. I have also used the "tinymce" plugin to incorporate the features of rich text editor which enhances the performance of the application too to handle the information user wants to save for future reference. For sending mails, service is being added that can be useful to the one's requiring this feature in there application.
